-- PROBLEM : 
Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation.
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:

+-------------+-----------+
|    COLUMN   |   Type    |
+-------------+-----------+
| NAME        | STING     |
| OCCUPATION  | STRING    |
+-------------+-----------+

Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

-- SOLUTION : ( MS SQL SERVER ) 

WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY OCCUPATION ORDER BY NAME ) AS RN , *
    FROM OCCUPATIONS )
SELECT Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor 
FROM CTE PIVOT ( MAX(NAME)FOR OCCUPATION IN (Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor) ) AS PV
